# How TypeScriptNYC works

TypeScript NYC is a regular meetup occurring in NYC. 

It's co-organized by:
 
 - [Dan Vanderkim](https://github.com/danvk)
 - [Kirill Cherkashin](https://github.com/kirjs)
 - [Jason Killian](https://github.com/JKillian)
 - [Orta Therox](https://github.com/orta)

## Aim per meetup

At each meetup we aim to have three 10-20m talks, aimed at three different audiences:

- Beginners (for example "How Type Definitions Work")
- Experienced (for example "What is type narrowing")
- Advanced (for example "How to create your own mapped types")

As well as a summary of changes to the language since the last meetup.

## Organization Discussion

We run the meetup inside the [TypeScript Community Discord](https://discord.gg/typescript/) in a channel called `#ts-nyc`. This is open for others to join and contribute, and we'd love more folks to be involved.

## Giving a talk

We'll start a thread in that channel and chat with you to get it scheduled.

## Schedule

We aim for meetups every 2 months. This used to coincide with TypeScript releases, but as of 3.6 TypeScript is released every 3 months instead. 

E.g:

- August 6th 2019
- October 2nd 2019

We aim to have the meetup on the 1st tuesday of every 2nd month. We aim to open the meetup event a few weeks before to give folks
a chance to sign up early.
